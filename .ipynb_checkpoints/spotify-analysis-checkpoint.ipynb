    "\n",
    "**Song iD:** The song ID provided by Spotify (unique to each song).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Streams:** Approximate number of streams the song has.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artist:** The main artist/ artists involved in making the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artist Followers:** The number of followers the main artist has on Spotify.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Popularity:** The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Danceability:** Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acousticness:** A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy:** Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Speechiness:** Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tempo:** The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Valence:** A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chord:** The main chord of the song instrumental."
