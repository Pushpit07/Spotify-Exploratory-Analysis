Over the centuries music has continued to be an indispensable aspect of our daily life. Not a day passes by without us humming a tune or listening to one. The sources of listening to music have also evolved over time. From the vintage vinyl discs through mix tapes through radio, our listening medium has now reached online music-streaming platforms of which Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, etc. are some of the most popular ones.

Spotify is a digital music service that gives its users access to millions of songs. With over [365 million](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/) people using Spotify each month, including 165 million premium subscribers, Spotify occupies the top spot.
Spotify's repository of music contains over 70 million songs and 2.9 million podcasts that are available on platform for everyone to listen!

As music aficionados, this prompted us to dig deeper into the Spotify songs database to discover interesting trends regarding the songs, their artists and hopefully help people discover new music.

The objective of this analysis is to explore the Spotify dataset through different visualizations and answer interesting questions to get more insights about the dataset.
